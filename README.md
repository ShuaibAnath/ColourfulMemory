# Colourful Memory
There are 4 levels of this game. This is a game designed using 1 RGB LED and 7 pushbuttons. Each pushbutton is a unique colour (Hardware setup is done using Wokwi and code is meant for use on Arduino Uno). The game begins by lighting the RGB LED in a specific sequence of colours. When the sequence finishes, the RGB LED will not be lit anymore. The user then attempts to press the pushbuttons with the same colours in the same sequence as shown by the RGB LED lighting sequence(i.e., if the RGB LED was lit green, blue, and then red, then the pushbuttons that must be pressed are green, blue, and red in the same order as the colours shown on the RGB LED). When the user presses a button the RGB LED lights up in the same colour as the button pressed, this occurs for each button pressed by the user. If the user presses the buttons in the same colour sequence shown on the RGB LED, an indication that they passed the level is shown, then the next level begins. The levels increase in difficulty with the RGB LED being lit in more colours at each level until the user finishes the game at the final level or when the user gets the sequence incorrect (by pressing the buttons in a different sequence than the one shown at the beginning of the level on the RGB LED).
