Introduction
In this practical you will be expected to design and simulate a mini-game. 
This practical will have 2 stages. The simulator tool that you will use for 
this project is Wokwi. It is a new simulator but quite feature rich.
Arduino has a webpage on how to use Wokwi 
(link: https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Hack-star-Arduino/how-to-use-wokwi-arduino-simulator-in-2022-what-is-wokwi-304e6b ). 
You can also check out Wokwi’s documentation (link: https://docs.wokwi.com/?utm_source=wokw ).

The game – Colourful Memory
There are 4 levels of this game. This is a game that you must design using 1 RGB LED 
and 7 pushbuttons. Each pushbutton is a different unique colour 
(Hardware setup is done for you). The game begins by lighting the RGB LED in a 
specific sequence of colours. When the sequence finishes, the RGB LED will not be lit 
anymore. The user then attempts to press the pushbuttons with the same colours in the 
same sequence as shown by the RGB LED lighting sequence(i.e., if the RGB LED was lit 
green, blue, and then red, then the pushbuttons that must be pressed are green, blue, 
and red in the same order as the colours shown on the RGB LED). When the user presses 
a button the RGB LED lights up in the same colour as the button pressed, this must 
occur for each button pressed by the user. If the user presses the buttons in the 
same colour sequence shown on the RGB LED, an indication that they passed the level 
must be shown, then the next level must begin. The levels increase in difficulty with 
the RGB LED being lit in more colours at each level until the user finishes the game 
at the final level or when the user gets the sequence incorrect 
(by pressing the buttons in a different sequence than the one shown at the 
beginning of the level on the RGB LED).
